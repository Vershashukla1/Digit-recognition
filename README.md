# Digit-recognition
# Handwritten Digit Recognition Competition
This repository hosts code for a on recognizing single digits from handwritten images. The goal is to accurately predict the digit represented in each image within the test set.

Goal:
Participants are tasked with developing models capable of correctly identifying the digits (0-9) present in handwritten images. The objective is to predict the correct label for each image in the test dataset.

Evaluation Metric:
The competition's evaluation metric is categorization accuracy, measured as the percentage of correctly predicted images. The accuracy of predictions on the test set determines the model's performance.

Repository Contents:
Data: Includes datasets for training, validation, and testing.
Code: Hosts scripts for model training, prediction, and evaluation.
README: Provides information on usage, dependencies, and guidelines.
Usage:
Data Preparation: Ensure datasets are appropriately organized for training and testing.
Model Training: Utilize scripts like train.py to train models on the provided training data.
Prediction: Run predict.py to predict labels for images within the test set.
Evaluation: Calculate categorization accuracy to assess model performance.
Dependencies:
Python 3.x
Required libraries specified in requirements.txt
TensorFlow/PyTorch (choose framework for model implementation)
Contributions:
Contributions, feedback, and enhancements are welcome! Please follow guidelines outlined in the repository to contribute effectively.



Note:
This competition emphasizes categorization accuracy as the primary evaluation metric.
